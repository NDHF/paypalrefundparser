# paypalrefundparser
A simple script parsing text from PayPal refunds.

This script was designed to streamline work at an earlier job.

The core functionality will allow the user to issue a refund on PayPal,
select and copy all text on the PayPal refund page, paste it into a text field,
and grab all the important information from it. 

The other part of the function makes it easy to generate various form e-mails.
